# ProjectDEA
a Compiler to compile deterministic finite state machines and run them on a virtual machine environment, can be expanded to be an IDE in the future

# First things first: how to run and compile
you can run the test automat by opening the compile.cmd, which will compile the program (assuming that you hava java installed and added to path), then it will run it with the test.dea file, you can show (and edit the file with a normal text editor -science we don't have any IDE yet-), the program will show the current state of the compiled automaton, and wait for input from the user
